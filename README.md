# Hey, I'm Sarah

My interest in data science began in my last year of college when I found so much joy in visualizing data. I am a visual learner and it is so much more intuitive and exciting to provide insights with all kinds of graphs. I am curious about many differnt things. I loves big ideas and making them happen. ðŸš€ 

I go into data science projects with an entrepreneurial and user-driven mindset, writing code that solves real world problems. I'm a project management enthusiast with a passion for data-driven innovative solutions. Strongly believe that no problem is too hard if you break it down into smaller pieces.

I have experience working in high-growth fintech startups, digital marketing, and client management. Above all, I'm excited about disruptive ideas that can create global change and elevate quality of life.

When I am not coding I like watching documentaries about nature. I also make music and enjoy good laughs with friends. 

### What I'm up to

- Received Kenneth Cooke fellowship grant from Pomona College to continue doing some more research on Topological Data Analysis (TDA). 
- Currently generating lots of network graphs and analysis in Twitter Space as a Data Scientist Intern at a crypto start-up (@the TIE)!!

### Previous Project Descriptions:
#### [Bayesian Bayesian Inference Model on Movie Recommendation System (Mar 2021 â€“ May 2021) ðŸ“‘](https://github.com/sarahheayoon/Netflix-IMDB-User-Recommendation)
- Created a Bayesian inference model to predict individual usersâ€™ preference on film based on their viewership and rating history
- Cleaned large datasets containing Netflix & IMDB movie ratings (2M movies) and user behaviors (143K users) in R to visualize viewership and rating distributions for the given sample of users

#### [NLP Project: Stock Prediction Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis (Sep 2021 â€“ Dec 2021) ðŸ“‘](https://github.com/sarahheayoon/NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)
- Trained machine learning models (CART, Random Forest, SVM) in R to predict stock performance with Twitter sentiment analysis, which resulted in 52% accuracy 
- Retrieved millions of tweets using Python and Twitter API, cleaned text data, generated sentiment scores based on augmented dictionary search
- Created a data processing pipeline and word cloud in R to visualize Twitter sentiment and stock trends of companies

#### [Multiple Regression Model on Renewable Energy (Sep 2021 â€“ Dec 2021) ðŸ“‘](https://github.com/sarahheayoon/Renewable-Energy-State-GDP-Political-Affiliation)
- Built a multiple regression model to predict stateâ€™s political affiliations by the type of renewable energy produced by cleaning 2020 election results by state, state energy consumption levels, renewable energy production levels by energy types

#### Optimization Model for Human Resource Scheduling Problem (Aug 2019 â€“ Dec 2019)
â€¢	Increased staffing efficiency by 30% by building an optimization model which was adopted by the executive team of the Mavenlink Inc
